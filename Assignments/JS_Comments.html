    Hello Bhekamagwala</p>

    <P>Great blog though I did not see images in it. You can use the img HTML element to get images onto your website. You can sign up for a free storage service from Microsoft called OneDrive and upload your pictures there. You then share the images in your OneDrive account and paste the URLs into your site. That way the images will always who up on your site.</P>
    
    <P>Good luck!</P>
