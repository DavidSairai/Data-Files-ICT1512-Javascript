<h1>A bit About David Sairai</h1>

<!-- Who am I section -->
<h2>Who Am I</h2>
My name is David Sairai and I am originally from Zimbabwe and been a resident citizen of the city of Cape Town since 2012. I currently work as an IT Support Engineer for a UK-based software company in Stellenbosch and have worked in various IT roles in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Harare my home city. 

<p>I had a weird start to my IT career. Started off at a Catholic boarding school called St Ignatius with ZX Spectrum and commodore (thank you, Fr. Wolfe). Then when varsity fell short as I did not meet the required grades to do a degree, I moved into the employment field in the fast-food area, then moved “up” the ladder to being a cashier at various retail stores.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as I was busy studying in IT part-time at night at a college in town when one day during my lunch break doing my college homework, a man came in at my workplace to buy some electrical cable for his business. We had a brief chat about all things in life and soon the direction of our conversation went into IT around computer games, the internet, Yahoo and Hotmail. It was then he saw my homework and said he had an opening at his company and if I was interested to join it as an IT Software Support Assistant. I resigned from that cashier job I was at the following day to enter the IT world.</p>

<p>I started my work in Linux and Windows 3.1, then moved to various SysAdmin roles for various companies, including some public-listed companies where I got involved and learnt various software, platforms and applications. I then bounced down to South Africa when I got a job in Johannesburg where I travelled all over SA overseeing the rollout of a Microsoft Retail POS system in various retail outlets. IN 2012, I public listed company headed hunted me on Linkedin and I relocated to Cape Town where I worked for five years before moving to an American global IT company for another two years where I learnt a lot about being humble, disciplined and pushing yourself to make your own career. This year I moved to Stellenbosch to a new role where I am currently at.</p>

<!-- Study section -->
<h2>Road to Studying</h2>

In 2021, I enrolled for the Diploma in Information Technology through the University of South Africa as I wanted to add a formal qualification. This is to formalise my education and move towards doing a degree thereafter as I only have done multiple vendor-based certifications. This module will help me in starting my journey in the world of programming, as this field is not only in demand but will add to my knowledge skillset which I can use in future. By having vendor-based ceritifications only validates your technical skills in that particular area or software but does not teach you the soft skills needed. You may end being stuck in that sector such only being knowledgeble in that vendor's ecosystem of applications and platforms

<h2>About The Blog</h2>
This blog will serve as a journal of my progression in attaining this qualification and will be updated regularly to keep you my avid readers of how I am doing. Thank you for reading it and feel free to comment on it.
