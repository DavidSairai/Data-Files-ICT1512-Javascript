<!-- About JavaScript section -->
<h1>INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT</h1>

<p>This Chapter looks at the history of the World Wide Web and how JavaScript evolved to been used in web development. It touches on the structure of client/server architecture and the use a protocol called Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or as its commonly called HTTP. A three-tier system evolved where the server part was split in processing tier and data storage tier. </p>

<p>As JavaScript runs locally on the device for security reason, you can add the code using the script element in the web document. This code is called scripts and is usually placed in the body section of the docuemtn to make it run effectiy. vThe use of variables is also common to assign a value to a name. </p>

<p>Finally, JavaScript uses what are called variables which are not only case sensitive but has reserved words called keywords. This chapter has giving me quick run down of what Javascript is and where it came from. It's interesting to note that Javascript came from a now defunct browser called Nestscape which was very popular '90s but lost the browser wars to Internet Explorer.</p>

<h1>WORKING WITH FUNCTIONS, DATA TYPES, AND OPERATORS</h1>

<p>This Chapter looks at functions, which is a bunch of JavaScript executed a single unit. A parameter or variable is usually placed in parenthesis like () but not always. You the use curly brackets or function braces to contain the statements. JavaScript code is always placed in an external file with <strong>.js</strong> file extension and can be referenced at the bottom of the HTML documents body section. </p> 

<p>You can use functions to respond to user input such as clicking a button and an alert box pops up on the screen by using methods which are supported by browsers namely HTML attributes, object properties, and event listener. <p> 

<p>Though the use of the keyword var is not mandatory, it is considered good coding practice as it shows that you are declaring a variable. Also, various operators are used to perform various operations. </p>

<p>The various operators need a lot of practice to get to know how eahc one works and when you can use it. </p>

<h1>BUILDING ARRAYS AND CONTROLLING FLOW</h1>

<p>In this chapter I saw that arrays are like a collection of similar data. The data can be accessed by using an index to retrieve it. Also, as in any programming language, you can reuse the same code in JavaScript by using a loop statement. Arrays always sart with index 0(zero) for each element stored in the element.  </p>

<p>During the course of writing your script, you will need to make certain decisions to see which code can execute and where. You may require to make a decision to find out which code to execute in an application. </p> 

<p>This chapter was tricky as I would sometimes output the incorrect data as I had accessed the wron index. Also the while, if and else if statements would cause my script go into a loop and this required more practising of how to use the various looping statements. </p>

<h1>DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING</h1>

<p>Every programmer makes mistakes and one must find a way of fixing these mistakes n the code. This process of is called debugging and has many techniques. This chapter focuses on the use of the web browser to find and fix the errors in your code. One will not have to use other tools or buy other software as the debugger is built into the browser such as the console, breakpoint and watchlist. You can also output these errors or see the what is goig on within the code to the  console or have alert box pop up at the set debuggung point. There are also online sites such the validator to make sure your code is correct. You can also use editors such VScode, Notepad or Atom whic validates syntax erros as you code.</p>

<p>Simple errors like spelling mistakes, incorrect syntax or incorrect placement of code in the script or document can result in your script or web page from not only running properly but also effectively. A good coder or programmer writes code that validates the data type input by the user. You would not want a telephone number entered by a user to be valid on the field of an email address. I also liked the idea of creating custome error messages when pne comes across errors in the code. </p>
